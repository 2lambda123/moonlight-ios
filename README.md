#Moonlight iOS

#### Update 7/16/15: We are not accepting more users into the beta program at this time. However, Moonlight iOS is getting ready to launch on the App Store. To be notified when this happens, [please sign up here](http://eepurl.com/btvkG9) to receive a one-time email notification when it's available to download onto your iOS device.

[Moonlight](https://github.com/moonlight-stream) is an open source implementation of NVIDIA's GameStream, as used by the NVIDIA Shield, but built for iOS. Moonlight iOS allows you to stream your full collection of Steam games from
your powerful desktop computer to your iOS Device.

This is actively being developed and will be available on the App Store soon - check back here or on [our website](http://moonlight-stream.com) for updates.

We understand that Moonlight users are eager for the opportunity to stream their Steam collection to their iOS devices. Moonlight for iOS is in the testing stage and preliminary versions are available for beta testers.

In the meantime, check out the existing versions for [Android](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-android) and [PC](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-pc). Also, a client for [Windows and Windows Phone](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-windows) is in the works and actively being developed.

Please be patient as we work to bring Moonlight to more platforms.
