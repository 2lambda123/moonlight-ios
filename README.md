#Limelight iOS

[Limelight](https://github.com/limelight-stream) is an open source implementation of NVIDIA's GameStream, as used by the NVIDIA Shield, but built for iOS. Limelight iOS will allow you to stream your full collection of Steam games from
your powerful desktop computer to your iOS Device.

This is actively being developed and should be available on the AppStore soon. 

We understand that Limelight users are eager for the opportunity to stream their Steam collection to their iOS devices. Limelight for iOS is in the testing stage and preliminary versions are available for beta testers.

In the meantime, check out the existing versions for [Android](https://github.com/limelight-stream/limelight-android) and [PC](https://github.com/limelight-stream/limelight-pc). Also, a client for [Windows and Windows Phone](https://github.com/limelight-stream/limelight-windows) is in the works and actively being developed.

Please be patient as we work to bring Limelight to more platforms.
