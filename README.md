#Limelight iOS

Limelight is an open source implementation of NVIDIA's GameStream, as used by the NVIDIA Shield,
but built for iOS. 

Limelight iOS allows you to stream your full collection of Steam games from
your powerful desktop computer to your iOS Device. 

[Limelight](https://github.com/limelight-stream) also has an Android
implementation, and versions for PC and Windows Phone are currently in development.
