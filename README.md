#Limelight iOS

[Limelight](https://github.com/limelight-stream) is an open source implementation of NVIDIA's GameStream, as used by the NVIDIA Shield, but built for iOS. Limelight iOS will allow you to stream your full collection of Steam games from
your powerful desktop computer to your iOS Device.

#####Limelight iOS is not stable or buildable - it is in the very early stages of development. Please refrain from opening issues regarding Limelight iOS - we know it doesn't work yet.

This is in development and is not considered stable (or buildable). Do not use it. It is not ready.

We understand that Limelight users are eager for the opportunity to stream their Steam collection to their iOS devices. Currently there is no ETA on an alpha version, but we'll post an update whenever we reach that stage.

In the meantime, check out the existing versions for [Android](https://github.com/limelight-stream/limelight-android) and [PC](https://github.com/limelight-stream/limelight-pc). Also, a client for [Windows Phone 8.1](https://github.com/limelight-stream/limelight-wp) is in the works and actively being developed.

Please be patient as we work to bring Limelight to more platforms.
